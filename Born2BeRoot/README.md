# Born2BeRoot

A system administration project from the 42 curriculum. You set up a Debian (or Rocky) virtual machine with strict security and configuration requirements.

## What It Covers

- **Virtualization**: Creating and configuring a VM (VirtualBox, UTM, or similar)
- **User & group management**: `sudo`, password policies
- **SSH**: Secure configuration, key-based auth
- **Firewall (UFW)**: Port rules and policies
- **Sudo & password policy**: `login.defs`, `sudoers`, password aging
- **Monitoring script**: Custom script that displays system info (cron-based)

## Project Structure

This is a system configuration project rather than a codebase. The deliverable typically includes:

- A correctly configured VM
- A signature file confirming the setup
- Documentation of the configuration steps

## Requirements

- Virtualization software (VirtualBox, UTM, VMware, etc.)
- Debian 11/12 or Rocky Linux
- Understanding of Linux system administration

## Note

The 42 Born2BeRoot project focuses on learning system administration concepts. The VM setup and configuration are done manually according to the subject PDF.
